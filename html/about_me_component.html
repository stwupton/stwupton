Hello, World! &#x1F642; My name is Steven Upton, I'm {{myAge}} years old and I
live in the UK. I'm a self-taught programmer who loves playing and creating
video games. I aspire to one day become a proffesional game designer and this
blog is me logging my journey towards that goal. So, I welcome you to embark on
this adventure with me and please... don't be shy. If you enjoy my content (or
don't!), leave a comment or get in touch through one of my social networks on
